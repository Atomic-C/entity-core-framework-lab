Because I didn't know much about databases.


What I learned from Entity Framework Core in .NET 5 (.NET Core) technology: 

Data Annotations
Migrations in EF Core
Fluent API
Add, update and remove objects (CRUD operations)
Apply best practices with Entity Framework
Understand relationships in Entity Framework Core
Bulk operations in Entity Framework Core
Change tracker, RAW SQL, Stored Procs, View, and much more.
