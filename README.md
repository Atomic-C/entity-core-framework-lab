Because I didn't know much about databases, I explored code first approach here to save time.


## What I learned from Entity Framework Core in .NET 5 (.NET Core) technology: ##

- Data Annotations
- Migrations in EF Core
- Fluent API
- Add, update and remove objects (CRUD operations)
- Apply best practices with Entity Framework
- Understand relationships in Entity Framework Core
- Bulk operations in Entity Framework Core
- Change tracker, RAW SQL, Stored Procs, View, and much more.
